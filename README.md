⚠️ Problem (Without Docker agents)

You’re building Subhadrafoods:

Stage 1 needs Java/Maven to build.

Stage 2 needs Node.js to run ESLint on frontend code.

Stage 3 needs Docker CLI to build/push images.

Stage 4 needs kubectl for deployment.

If you run Jenkins on a plain VM:

You’d have to install Maven, JDK, Node.js, npm, Docker, kubectl all on that Jenkins VM.

Over time → versions conflict (Maven 3.6 vs 3.9, Node 16 vs 18), packages get outdated, and builds break.

If you scale Jenkins to another VM, you have to reinstall everything again.

Result → "Dependency hell" and environment drift.

✅ Solution (With Docker agents)

Instead of installing everything on the Jenkins VM:

Each stage runs in its own Docker agent:

Build → maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17

Lint → node:18-alpine

Docker Build → docker:20.10.24-dind-rootless

Deploy → bitnami/kubectl:1.28

Benefits:

No conflicts → Every tool version is isolated.

Reproducibility → Pipeline works the same on any Jenkins server.

Lightweight → Jenkins VM stays clean (just needs Docker installed).

Flexibility → Easily upgrade tool versions by just changing image tag.

🔎 Example: Why Docker agents fix it

Without Docker agent: Maven 3.6 installed globally → someone upgrades it to 3.9 for another project → your old build fails.

With Docker agent: Your pipeline always uses maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17, unaffected by system upgrades.
